### 🦠 [Project 4](https://github.com/mfarhanrais/SG-DSI-39/tree/main/project_4a) 🦠: Predicting the Spread of West Nile Virus

*`To effectively plan the deployment of pesticides in order to mitigate the spread of the West Nile Virus in Chicago City by producing a predictive model and cost benefit analysis.`*

From past data, 25 classifier models were rapidly built before tuning a final model to predict the spread of the virus.

> Recommender systems, deep learning, neural networks, unsupervised learning, time series, geospatial analysis, Folium, LazyPredict, XGBClassifier

### 🏃🏽 [Capstone Project](https://github.com/mfarhanrais/SG-DSI-39/tree/main/capstone) 🏃🏽: Injury Prediction, Prevention & Performance Tool (IPPPT)

*`How can trainers and individuals use machine learning to analyse heart rate data from wearables in order to review training performance and highlight those at risk of injury in order achieve IPPT Gold standards before attempting IPPT?`*

Aggregated heart rate data using API from Strava to build a Tableau dashboard and build a predictive model to be deployed on a web app.

> API, Tableau, PyCaret, Streamlit
